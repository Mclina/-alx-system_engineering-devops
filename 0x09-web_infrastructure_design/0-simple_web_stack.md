Description


 ** Server**: This is a physical or virtual machine that hosts all the components necessary for serving the website content to users. In this scenario, it hosts the Nginx web server, the application server, the application files (your code base), and the MySQL database.

 **Domain Name (foobar.com)**: The domain name serves as an easy-to-remember address for accessing websites. Instead of remembering an IP address (like 8.8.8.8), users can type www.foobar.com into their browser to visit your website.

 **DNS Record for www**: The 'www' in www.foobar.com is a specific type of DNS record, typically a CNAME or an A record, which maps the domain name to the server's IP address (in this case, 8.8.8.8). This tells the internet where to find the website.

**Web Server (Nginx)**: The web server's role is to accept incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers and respond with the requested web pages. Nginx can also serve static content, handle SSL termination, and perform load balancing.

 **Application Server**: This server runs your application's code. It handles dynamic content by executing the application code based on the request's requirements and, often, querying the database for data. The application server works in conjunction with the web server to generate the dynamic content to be served to the user.

**Database (MySQL)**: The database stores all the data needed by your application, such as user profiles, blog posts, etc. When the application needs to retrieve or store data, it queries the MySQL database.

. **Server Communication with User's Computer**: The communication between the server and the user's computer is done over the Internet using the HTTP/HTTPS protocols. When a user requests www.foobar.com, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which processes it and sends back an HTTP response.

# Issues with This Infrastructure

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Since everything is hosted on a single server, any problem with that server (hardware failure, software crash, etc.) would make the entire website unavailable.

2. **Downtime for Maintenance**: Whenever you need to perform maintenance tasks, like deploying new code or updates which require a web server restart, the website will be temporarily unavailable.

3. **Scalability**: This setup can handle only a limited amount of traffic. If your website becomes popular and receives too much incoming traffic, this single server setup will struggle to handle the load, leading to slow response times or even total outages.
