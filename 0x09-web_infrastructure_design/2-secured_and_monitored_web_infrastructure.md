Description

 Added Components and Their Purposes:

1. **3 Firewalls**: One firewall is placed in front of the load balancer, another in front of the application servers, and the last one in front of the database server. These firewalls serve to control and monitor the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, providing a barrier against unauthorized access to the network.

2. **1 SSL Certificate**: This certificate is used to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, ensuring that all data transmitted between the web server and browsers remain encrypted and secure from eavesdroppers.

3. **3 Monitoring Clients**: A monitoring client, such as those provided by SumoLogic or similar services, is installed on each server. These clients collect and send data to the monitoring service for real-time analysis and alerting. This data includes metrics, logs, and other insights into the health and performance of the infrastructure.

 Explanation of Additional Elements:

- **Firewalls**: They are crucial for defining a security posture, allowing only permitted traffic to pass through to the servers based on rules (such as allowed IP addresses, protocols, and ports) and blocking potentially harmful traffic.

- **HTTPS**: Serving traffic over HTTPS is essential for securing data in transit, ensuring that sensitive information (like login credentials and personal information) is encrypted. This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and is also beneficial for SEO rankings and user trust.

- **Monitoring**: Monitoring is used to observe the health and performance of your web infrastructure, allowing for proactive management of issues before they impact users. It can help detect downtime, performance bottlenecks, security threats, and more.

- **Collecting Data for Monitoring**: The monitoring tools typically collect data through agents installed on the servers, which gather logs, metrics, and other relevant data points. This data is then sent to a central location for analysis, visualization, and alerting.

- **Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second)**: To monitor your web server's QPS, you can configure the monitoring tool to collect and analyze the web server access logs or use a performance monitoring tool that tracks this metric directly. Setting thresholds for alerts can notify you when the QPS is unusually high or low, indicating potential issues or changes in traffic patterns.

 Infrastructure Issues:

- **Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer**: Terminating SSL at the load balancer level means that traffic from the load balancer to the web servers is often unencrypted, creating a potential vulnerability within the internal network. If an attacker gains access to the internal network, they could intercept unencrypted traffic.

- **Single MySQL Server for Writes**: Having only one MySQL server that can accept write operations creates a single point of failure (SPOF) for the database layer. If this server goes down, the application can no longer process write operations, impacting the site's functionality.

- **Servers with All Same Components**: Having a setup where each server hosts the database, web server, and application server can lead to resource contention, where one component's needs adversely affect the performance of the others. It also complicates scaling individual components based on their specific load or requirements and can increase the attack surface for potential security threats.
